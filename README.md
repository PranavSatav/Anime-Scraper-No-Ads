# Anime-Scraper-No-Ads
The project is a web-based image gallery application that fetches and displays unique anime cover image URLs from specified pages and the home page. It presents a Netflix-style grid layout with separate sections for "Dub" and "Others" images, allowing users to search and filter images dynamically.
